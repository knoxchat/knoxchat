### Memory Brain System Upgrades

- **Input Sanitizer** — Security scanning on all memory writes (prompt injection, credential detection, invisible Unicode removal)
- **Context Fencing** — Recalled memories wrapped in safe boundary tags to prevent instruction injection
- **Tool Splitting** — Single 79-action memory tool split into 5 focused sub-tools: Memory, Memory Graph, Memory Sessions, Memory Manage, Memory Learn
- **FTS5 Fusion Search** — SQLite FTS5 full-text search with BM25 ranking, trigram fuzzy matching, and Bloom filter deduplication (replaces vector embeddings)
- **Multi-Strategy Retrieval** — Weighted fusion of FTS5, trigram, graph traversal, recency decay, and importance scoring with auto-detected query-type weights
- **LLM Reranking** — Optional LLM-based reranking pass on top-K retrieval candidates
- **Frozen Snapshot Pattern** — Session-scoped context caching with automatic invalidation after significant changes
- **Memory Provider Interface** — Plugin architecture for external memory backends (cloud, team-shared, vector DBs)
- **Cloud Sync** — Compressed backup/restore of memory database with cloud storage integration
- **Knox-MS Server Sync** — Background sync of local memories to Knox-MS server with change tracking and conflict resolution
- **Working Memory Persistence** — Serialize/restore working memory state across sessions with time-decay on restore
- **Capacity-Aware Auto-Pruning** — Proactive consolidation triggered when memory count approaches configured limits
- **Auto-Consolidation Scheduling** — Timer-based consolidation with capacity threshold checks

### Memory Dashboard UI

- **4-Tab Dashboard** — Overview, Memories, Graph, and Settings tabs with Lucide icons
- **Overview Page** — Health banner, 8 stat cards, tier distribution bars, category breakdown, entity types, recent sessions, consolidation stats, and memory timeline
- **Memory Browser** — Search with debounce, category/tier filters, sort options, expandable detail view, selection mode with bulk actions
- **Knowledge Graph** — Entity search, type filtering, interactive graph exploration with depth traversal
- **Settings Page** — Toggle/number controls for auto-memory, capacity, search engine (FTS5/trigram/bloom), and maintenance actions
- **Export Fixed** — Export now returns actual JSON data and saves file to ~/.knox/brain/
- **Delete Safety** — Delete uses proper forget() with checkpoint creation and event emission
- **Confirmation Dialogs** — All destructive actions (delete, bulk delete, purge, consolidate) require confirmation
- **Error Feedback** — Success/error toasts on all operations with auto-dismiss
- **Consolidation Feedback** — Shows promoted/demoted/pruned/merged counts after consolidation
- **Pagination** — Memory browser uses page-size 50 with "Load More" instead of hardcoded limit
- **Dashboard GraphStats Fix** — Proper field remapping for entity/edge counts in overview
- **Import Endpoint** — New brain/import protocol endpoint for memory restore
- **Full i18n** — All UI strings localized in English and Chinese (130+ keys)

### Checkpoint System Upgrade

- **Restore Safety & Storage Accuracy** — Interactive conflict prompting, restore fallback handling, verified backup flow, timestamp restoration, real compression and deduplication metrics, content reference counting, and storage garbage collection
- **Semantic Checkpoint Intelligence** — Symbol extraction and resolution, clone detection, pattern detection, dependency graph analysis, affected-feature/layer classification, and checkpoint risk and impact analysis
- **Advanced Diff & Comparison** — Word-level and syntax-highlighted diffs, semantic change annotations, JSON/CSS-specific diff modes, inline gutter restore actions, side-by-side checkpoint comparison, and 3-way compare against the current workspace
- **VS Code Checkpoint UX** — Checkpoint tree view with pagination, search/filter, grouping, icons, context actions, stronger native-module error handling, retry logic, and enterprise health monitoring with status bar indicators
- **Visualization & Export Tools** — Completed evolution timeline interactions, dependency graph layouts/tooltips/legends, and bulk checkpoint export as JSON, ZIP, and Markdown with progress feedback
- **Branching, Collaboration & Monitoring** — Incremental checkpoints, branch creation/switch/merge, shared bundles, cross-machine sync, audit trail, and performance dashboards for storage, restorations, and AI session productivity
- **Checkpoint Test Coverage** — Added backend, extension, and GUI test coverage for restore flows, conflicts, sessions, dashboards, comparison flows, and implementation-plan completeness
